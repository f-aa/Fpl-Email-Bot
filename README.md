# Fpl Email Bot

FPL Email Bot extracts information from the FPL API and creates a summary with weekly winners, losers, and certain fun facts. It emails the summary to a set list of emails once the GW has completed.

Example email body:

Beep boop! I am a robot. This is your weekly FPL update.

The winner for gameweek #7 was Gnarly Norwegians with 82 points! Rounding up the top 3 for the week was Kick it in the net!! (72 pts) and The B Team (63 pts).

The worst ranking teams this week were The Goon Squad (44 pts), Kotterpool (43 pts), Relegation FC (39 pts), and Big Red Dog (32 pts). You should probably be embarrassed. 

When it came to captaincy choice Kick it in the net!! did the best this week with 26 point from Harry Kane. On the other end of the spectrum were The Goon Squad who had picked Sadio ManÃ© for a total of 2 points. You receive the armband of shame for this week. 

Gnarly Norwegians with 482 total points is the new league leader, supplanting last weeks leader Goes to 11. At the other end Big Red Dog is the new sap in last place with a miserable 295 points total.

As for shakers and movers Man City Minions climbed 4 spots this week. In the not so great department we have Relegation FC dropping 3 spots.

Notable news:

- 10 teams managed to reach or beat the overall average of 51 points for the week. 
- FC Grunge left an extraordinary 23 points on the bench which was the highest in the league.
- Gear (-4 pts) and Slaughterhouse 11 (-4 pts) both took transfer hits.
- Gnarly Norwegians (wildcard) was the only team to use a chip this week.

Your friendly FPL bot will return next gameweek with another update.

## Requirements

- Windows OS
- An email account
- An FPL account
- Azure subscription (optional)

## Setup

Download the latest release (https://github.com/f-aa/Fpl-Email-Bot/releases) and unzip it into a folder on your computer. Open the FplBot.exe.config with a text editor (like Notepad) and fill in all the required values. Follow the instructions in the configuration file for help. If you are planning on running the file locally from your computer you can keep the useAzure and azureBlobStorage settings as they are. Make sure you save your file before attempting to run the bot.

> **PLEASE NOTE**
> 
> Starting with the 2019/2020 season the FPL API requires an authenticated user to view leagues and league standings. Due to this a username and password is required for the FPL Email Bot to function. The username and password will only be used to connect to the site to fetch league standings and does not get sent anywhere else.
> 
> The username/password does not require to be in the league you are monitoring. Create a dummy account if you don't want to use your main account.

After finishing configuring the bot you can double-click the FplBot.exe file (or run from command-line) and it will process all gameweeks up until the current one. Which gameweek to process next is controlled by the gameweek.txt file so make sure you don't delete it. Once all gameweeks have been processed you can close the window. Run it again every time a gameweek finished (or keep it running for the next 6 months, who am I to tell you what to do).

If you want to run it as an automated webjob in Azure make sure you enter your Azure connection strings as well as set useAzure to true. Also include a name you want to use for the blog storage. If you pick a name that doesn't exist one will be created for you. Next zip all your files up and upload as an Azure webjob. Make sure you set it to continuous and single-instance. If you don't understand anything in this paragraph you should only run it from your computer.

## How are weekly winners determined

Currently weekly winners are calculated using the Dan Davies rule. Rather than just being the highest scoring team for the GW, it's the highest score with the total transfer cost for that week subtracted.

Example:

- Team A has 60 points and took 2 hits for a total of -8pts.
- Team B has 58 points and took 1 hit for a total of -4 pts.
- All other teams have less than 50 points

The winner would be Team B with 58 - 4 = 54 points, and Team B would be in second place with 60 - 8 = 52 pts.

## To-do

- Add configuration to disable Dan Davies rule
